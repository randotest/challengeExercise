# challengeExercise
This repository is for the challenge exercise issued

Since I have no experience in using github and have to send instructions.
I wrote everything in a html file. Normally I would separate the HTML, JavaScript and CSS file.
Doing it this way makes it easier to get things to work as it should without tring to locate the files.

instructions:
download and open the html file in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
